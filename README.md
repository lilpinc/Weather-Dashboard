challenge 6 - weather dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard that allows you to look up the daily weather and also the future 5 days of a chosen location. It displays an icon of the weather, the temperature, humidity, and windspeed. When a user enters in a location into the search bar it is recieved and stored into local storage and also displayed on the search history so that the user can click on it if they want to see the weather for that location again.
